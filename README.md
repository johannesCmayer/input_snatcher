# input_snatcher
Program to send keyboard input from an android phone to a computer. Useful to send Gboard's ASR to your computer.

You need to run [this server](https://github.com/johannesCmayer/shell-fish-legs/blob/main/python/input_snatcher_server) on your computer. IP adresses are hardcoded right now, so you need to change them manually in the source code, and redeploy the app to your device.
